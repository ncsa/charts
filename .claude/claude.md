## Repository Guidelines

Before working on any tasks in this repository, **always read the [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) file** first. 

The AGENTS.md file is the source of truth for all repository conventions, including:
- Directory structure and chart organization
- GitHub Actions automation requirements
- Version management and bumping rules
- Changelog requirements
- Git workflow restrictions (no direct pushes!)
- Guidelines for adding new charts
- File relationships and dependencies

**Important**: If you discover new rules or patterns during work, update AGENTS.md to keep it current.
